# ArcGIS Web App Builder

# What Is An ArcGIS Web App?

Web AppBuilder for ArcGIS is an intuitive what-you-see-is-what-you-get (WYSIWYG) application that allows you to build 2D and 3D web apps without writing a single line of code. It includes powerful tools to configure fully featured HTML apps. As you add your map and tools, you can see them in the app, and use them right away.

A published web app is based on a map authored with Map Viewer. Any changes the author makes to the map, including its extent, layers, description, and so on, are reflected in the web app. If a map that was available to everyone in the organization is made private (or deleted), the map no longer appears in the app.

## Choose a Theme

### What Is a Theme

A theme is a template framework representing the look and feel of an app. Content in a theme includes a collection of panels, styles, and layouts, and a set of preconfigured theme widgets. An app can include more than one theme, but it can only use one theme while running.

Content in this section was adapted from [“Create Apps: Themes” (ArcGIS.com)](https://doc.arcgis.com/en/web-appbuilder/create-apps/themes-tab.htm)

### Available Themes

<img class="aligncenter size-medium" src="https://doc.arcgis.com/en/web-appbuilder/create-apps/GUID-E521691F-6DB4-4DD6-8645-C5CB7560D4F8-web.png" width="388" height="562">

<table><tbody><tr><td><b>Theme Name</b></td><td><b>Theme Description</b></td></tr><tr><td>Billboard</td><td>For apps with simple tasks. It has the most layouts of all the themes and does not display the logo, links, and widget controller. All the widgets in the theme are on-screen widgets.</td></tr><tr><td>Box</td><td>Focuses on the widgets in the widget controller. By default, all on-screen widgets are turned off. There are no placeholders for widgets and no logo or links display. It is for apps that require a clean look on the map.</td></tr><tr><td>Dart</td><td>Widgets in the widget controller display as placeholder widgets. You can have multiple widgets open and move them around. By default, all on-screen widgets are turned off. Similar to the Box theme, there are no placeholders for widgets and no logo or links display.</td></tr><tr><td>Dashboard</td><td>All the widgets in the panel open simultaneously when the app starts. It is designed to visualize widgets and their communication directly. You can modify the predefined layout by adding or removing grids, or resizing the grids in the panel. By default, most on-screen widgets are turned off except the Home, Zoom Slider, and Full Screen widgets. Optionally, you can turn on the Header widget to display the logo, the app name, and links.</td></tr><tr><td>Foldable</td><td>All the widgets in the panel open simultaneously when the app starts. It is designed to visualize widgets and their communication directly. You can modify the predefined layout by adding or removing grids, or resizing the grids in the panel. By default, most on-screen widgets are turned off except the Home, Zoom Slider, and Full Screen widgets. Optionally, you can turn on the Header widget to display the logo, the app name, and links.</td></tr><tr><td>Jewelry Box</td><td>Evolved from the Foldable theme with a focused widget on the left of the app. It is for apps with a workflow task.</td></tr><tr><td>Launchpad</td><td>For users who prefer the Apple Mac style. It allows you to open multiple widgets, and move, resize, and minimize them.</td></tr><tr><td>Plateau</td><td>Can be used to create a modern and basic app with flat toolbars and widget containers.</td></tr><tr><td>Pocket</td><td>For apps that will be embedded in websites, story maps, or other locations with surrounding context.&nbsp; Only one widget is supported in a panel that can be positioned on the left or the right.</td></tr><tr><td>Tab</td><td>As with the Foldable theme, it supports all widget types and can be used for apps with complicated tasks.</td></tr></tbody></table><p><i>Content in this section was adapted from “</i><a href="https://doc.arcgis.com/en/web-appbuilder/create-apps/themes-tab.htm"><i>Create Apps: Themes</i></a><i>” (ArcGIS.com)</i>

### Theme Style

Available styles vary depending on the theme selected. Most themes have seven predefined colors from which to choose, except the Launchpad and Dashboard themes. If your organization has defined the shared theme with a header color, it will be the default color when an app is created.

<img class="aligncenter size-medium" src="https://doc.arcgis.com/en/web-appbuilder/create-apps/GUID-A54B8962-C858-4E83-BBC4-5F263C546040-web.png" width="353" height="116">

You can also choose your own color by clicking the last color in the color picker.

Content in this section was adapted from [“Create Apps: Themes” (ArcGIS.com)](https://doc.arcgis.com/en/web-appbuilder/create-apps/themes-tab.htm)

### Theme Layout

A layout represents a preset placement of user interface items. 

<img class="aligncenter size-medium" src="https://doc.arcgis.com/en/web-appbuilder/create-apps/GUID-37FFE688-CA24-40CB-8E02-1C0C9A3E23AF-web.png" width="359" height="218">

Only the Dashboard theme allows you to modify and generate your own layout.

When you build 2D apps, the available layouts vary depending on the theme selected. In addition, there are two styles of layout. One is for desktop and one is for mobile devices. When either the height or width of a screen display is less than 600 pixels, the mobile layout applies.

When you build 3D apps, each theme has two layouts for desktop only.

## Select a Map or Scene

## Add Widgets

Web AppBuilder includes many out-of-the-box widgets. These widgets provide fundamental functions to easily create web apps. Most of them have parameters that allow configuration and customization. Widgets added from the Choose Widget window can be set to open automatically when an app starts. In general, widgets are categorized as two types: off-panel and in-panel.

Content in this section was adapted from [“Create Apps: Widget Overview” (ArcGIS.com)](https://doc.arcgis.com/en/web-appbuilder/create-apps/widget-overview.htm)

### Off-Panel Widgets

Off-panel widgets can be turned on or off but cannot be removed from an app. They can be added to the controller. The off-panel widgets embedded in a theme display when the Widget tab is activated.

To turn on or off a widget, hover over the widget and click the eye icon.

Content in this section was adapted from [“Create Apps: Widget Overview” (ArcGIS.com)](https://doc.arcgis.com/en/web-appbuilder/create-apps/widget-overview.htm)

### In-Panel Widgets

In-panel widgets are available to the widget controllers and can be added to your app. By default, they are contained by a controller. Depending on which theme you choose, they may show in the upper right corner of the app with the header controller in a Foldable theme or on the left side of the app with the side controller in the Tab theme.

Each in-panel widget requires user interactions on the panel. 

In addition, in-panel widgets are associated with placeholders that define the position of an in-panel widget on the screen. You can drag the in-panel widget onto the map when it opens. You can also resize the panel of the widget by dragging its lower right corner.

To remove the widget, hover over the widget and click the x icon.
